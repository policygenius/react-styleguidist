This project is a fork of the very awesome [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/). You can find out more by reading their documentation.

## What's different?

- RCL logo and loader are hard coded
- Plain CSS classes that are used by the [PolicyGenius RCL](https://github.com/policygenius/athenaeum)
- Updated filtering / search to allow for the whole RCL to be filtered, instead of just the TOC
- Top level sections that are used as pages with simulated SPA routing
- Various styling updates
